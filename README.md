# Warriors Haven Framework

Warriors Haven Framework is our attempt at building our own I&A gamemode from
the ground up, porting over features we've developed in our modified version of
[Quiksilver's Invade & Annex], and rewriting everything else to (hopefully)
improve stability and make it easier to develop new objectives and functionality.

## Summary

Warriors Haven Framework provides a reoccurring main objective and side objectives
procedurally generated across the map, using terrain features and marked locations
to take full advantage of the map's topography. The main objective aims for
infantry-focused combat, providing lightly armored vehicles and turrets that
players can dispatch with their firearms alone. However, players can also opt for
combined arms tactics, with dozens of ground and aerial vehicles to choose from.

Worried about playing this gamemode alone? Recruits are always available to fight
with you, capable of reviving and sustaining themselves in prolonged firefights.
When you get incapacitated without a medic nearby, use up your medical supplies
to revive yourself and get back into combat. If you're not keen on driving across
the map to reach the next objective, request a halo jump from anywhere and dive
down in a line of parachutes.

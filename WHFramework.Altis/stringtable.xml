                This is a persistent, Invade &amp;amp; Annex-like mission where
                players are working together to complete procedurally generated
                objectives across the map of %1.

                This mission was developed by thegamecracks and Vicious Resilience
                as part of the Warriors Haven community. This took a lot of hard
                work to make, so thank you for playing!

                Playing solo and want a taste of combat? Grab yourself your
                favorite gun and a lot of first aid kits, then recruit some AI

                When available, halo jumping may be accessed from anywhere by
                holding the Context Menu keybind. This allows you to drop over
                any location of your choosing, as long as it is not within coverage
                of enemy anti-air vehicles. Halo jumps can carry along AI recruits
                and vehicles.

                &lt;br/&gt;
                If you have CBA installed, you can customize how high you want
                to be dropped off, when recruit/vehicle parachutes automatically
                deploy, and the separation between your units.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
                Depending on server settings, halo jumping may become hidden
                after a certain number of players have joined.

                NOTE: this section does not apply if ACE Medical is loaded.

                &lt;br/&gt;
                Once you have been significantly wounded, you will become incapacitated
                and unable to move. There are four ways to recover from incapacitation:
                &lt;br/&gt;
                1. Press Escape and respawn back at base;
                   &lt;br/&gt;
                2. Pray for an act of god;
                   &lt;br/&gt;
                3. Wait for a player medic to revive you, or;
                   &lt;br/&gt;
                4. Perform a self-revive.
                   &lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
                Depending on server settings, options (3) and (4) may have different
                requirements to succeed. By default, players can only revive units
                when they are a Medic, have a Medkit on hand, and have one First Aid Kit
                to be consumed. The last two item requirements will check the
                incapacitated unit's inventory first, so medics that have forgotten
                their medkit or have ran out of first aid kits can still perform
                revives on anyone that has the necessary items themselves.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
                For self-reviving, this option typically appears after three seconds,
                and allows any player with at least three First Aid Kits to self-revive
                themselves.

                Certain objects around the base, typically flag poles, may serve

                Engineers, and Medics.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
                Each time you select a role for your next recruit, they will
                receive the last loadout you used in that role. If you have yet
                to play as that role, or have not yet made a loadout for it,
                they will receive a default loadout. In this case, you can edit
                their loadout by looking at them and using the Edit Recruit Loadout
                action. The loadout you give them will be saved to the role,
                allowing you to reuse the loadout for future recruits.
                &lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
                Depending on server settings, recruit actions may become hidden
                after a certain number of players have joined.

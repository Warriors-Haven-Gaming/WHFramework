                    When available, halo jumping may be accessed from anywhere by
                    holding the Context Menu keybind. This allows you to drop over
                    any location of your choosing, as long as it is not within coverage
                    of enemy anti-air vehicles. Halo jumps can carry along AI recruits
                    and vehicles.

                    &lt;br/&gt;
                    If you have CBA installed, you can customize how high you want
                    to be dropped off, when recruit/vehicle parachutes automatically
                    deploy, and the separation between your units.

                    3. Wait for a player medic to revive you, or;
                    &lt;br/&gt;
                    4. Perform a self-revive.
                    &lt;br/&gt;
                    &lt;br/&gt;
                    Depending on server settings, options (3) and (4) may have different
                    requirements to succeed. By default, players can only revive units
                    when they are a Medic, have a Medkit on hand, and have one First Aid Kit
                    to be consumed. The last two item requirements will check the
                    incapacitated unit's inventory first, so medics that have forgotten
                    their medkit or have ran out of first aid kits can still perform
                    revives on anyone that has the necessary items themselves.
                    &lt;br/&gt;
                    &lt;br/&gt;
                    For self-reviving, this option typically appears after three seconds,
                    and allows any player with at least three First Aid Kits to self-revive
                    themselves. Depending on server settings, self-reviving may become hidden
                    after a certain number of players have joined.

                    Certain objects around the base, typically flag poles, may serve
                    as places for group leaders to request AI recruits. Recruits can
                    be spawned for a subset of player roles, including AT Specialists,
                    Engineers, and Medics.

                    &lt;br/&gt;
                    Each time you select a role for your next recruit, they will
                    receive the last loadout you used in that role. If you have yet
                    to play as that role, or have not yet made a loadout for it,
                    they will receive a default loadout. In this case, you can edit
                    their loadout by looking at them and using the Edit Recruit Loadout
                    action. The loadout you give them will be saved to the role,
                    allowing you to reuse the loadout for future recruits.

                    Depending on server settings, players and AI with backpack drones
                    may be able to assemble them as FPV drones. After placing these
                    drones on the ground, they will autonomously target enemies and
                    attempt to explode within proximity of them. Shooting the drone
                    or killing the pilot will also cause the drone to detonate.
                    &lt;br/&gt;

                    You can assemble your own FPV drones by wearing a backpack drone
                    and selecting Assemble FPV Drone.
                    If this option does not show up, either the server has FPV drones
                    disabled, or FPV drones can only be assembled by Drone Operators.
                    Beware, these drones cannot be disassembled or remote controlled,
                    and can explode themselves even when there are friendlies nearby!

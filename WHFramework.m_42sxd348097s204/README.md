# Warriors Haven Framework

Warriors Haven Framework is our attempt at building our own I&A gamemode from
the ground up, porting over features we've developed in our modified version of
Quiksilver's Invade & Annex, and rewriting everything else to (hopefully)
improve stability and make it easier to develop new objectives and functionality.

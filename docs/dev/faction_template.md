# Copying Classnames
To copy the classnames for each category, spawn in the types you want in Eden Editor,
select them, right click, and use the `Log > Log Classes as String to Clipboard` action.

# Copying Required Addons
To copy the required addons, pick one unit and vehicle type and paste them into
the following command:

```sqf
configSourceAddonList (configFile >> "CfgVehicles" >> "unit_or_vehicle_type") # 0
```

Paste again into the Debug Console and press "Local Exec" to execute it.
The result should be an addon name that your faction depends on.
Add it to the Faction ID entry you created in [fn_isFactionSupported.sqf].
If your faction includes assets from multiple mods, be sure to include
at least one addon name from each mod.





# Unit Types
This section covers infantry types used for patrols, garrisons, and vehicle crew.
These types are added to [fn_getUnitTypes.sqf].

## Standard
Majority of infantry types go here, including AT/AA specialists, squad leaders,
UAV operators, marksmen, grenadiers, and light units. If faction has no UAV operators,
consider adding a vanilla UAV operator to grant that faction FPV drone capabilities,
if it makes sense in context of their setting. All garrisons use standard infantry types.

```sqf
"O_T_Soldier_A_F"
"O_T_Soldier_AAR_F"
"O_T_Soldier_AHAT_F"
"O_T_Soldier_AAA_F"
"O_T_Soldier_AAT_F"
"O_T_Soldier_AR_F"
"O_T_Medic_F"
"O_T_Engineer_F"
"O_T_Soldier_Exp_F"
"O_T_Soldier_GL_F"
"O_T_Soldier_M_F"
"O_T_Soldier_AA_F"
"O_T_Soldier_AT_F"
"O_T_Soldier_Repair_F"
"O_T_Soldier_F"
"O_T_Soldier_LAT_F"
"O_T_Soldier_HAT_F"
"O_T_Soldier_SL_F"
"O_T_Soldier_TL_F"
"O_T_Soldier_UAV_F"
```

## Officer
Units dedicated to commanding, like "Officer" and "Commander". Units may be unarmed.
Appears only in specific objectives like Eliminate Commander in Annex Region.
Loadouts should be unique to help players visually identify them.

```sqf
"O_T_officer_F"
```

## Crew
Units dedicated to vehicle crew. Not currently used in objectives, but is
preferable to add any here in case of future missions. One unit type is sufficient.
If no one fits this category, a subset of units from the standard category can be reused.

```sqf
"O_T_Crew_F"
```

## Divers
Units specialized for underwater operations. Not currently used in objectives, but is
preferable to add any here in case of future missions. One unit type is sufficient.
If no one fits this category, a subset of units from the standard category can be reused.
Most factions don't have this, in which case a vanilla diver type can be used.

```sqf
"O_diver_F"
"O_diver_exp_F"
"O_diver_TL_F"
```

## Recons
Units with lighter loadouts and usually suppressed weaponry. Spawns with higher
skill than standard units. Loadouts should be unique so these groups can be visually distinguished.
If no one fits this category, a subset of units from the standard category can be reused.

```sqf
"O_T_Recon_Exp_F"
"O_T_Recon_JTAC_F"
"O_T_Recon_M_F"
"O_T_Recon_Medic_F"
"O_T_Recon_F"
"O_T_Recon_LAT_F"
"O_T_Recon_TL_F"
```

## Elites
Units dedicated to special operations, such as CSAT Viper teams. Spawns with even
higher skill than recon units. Because of this, loadouts should be unique to
help players visually identify them. If no spec ops-like units are available,
sleeve-less or uniquely-colored clothing can be used. Avoid unit reuse from
other categories.

```sqf
"O_V_Soldier_Exp_ghex_F"
"O_V_Soldier_jtac_ghex_F"
"O_V_Soldier_m_ghex_F"
"O_V_Soldier_ghex_F"
"O_V_Soldier_Medic_ghex_F"
"O_V_Soldier_lat_ghex_F"
"O_V_Soldier_TL_ghex_F"
```

## Snipers
Units with sniper rifles and usually camouflaged uniforms. Spawns with the
highest skill of all units. Because of this, loadouts should be unique to
help players visually identify them. If no units with sniper rifles are available,
consider removing marksman units from the standard category and placing them here.
Avoid unit reuse from other categories.

```sqf
"O_ghillie_lsh_F"
"O_ghillie_sard_F"
"O_T_Sniper_F"
"O_T_ghillie_tna_F"
```

## Helicopter Pilots
Units suited for flying that faction's rotary aircraft. One unit type is sufficient.
If no one fits this category, a subset of units from the standard category can be reused.

```sqf
"O_T_Helicrew_F"
"O_T_Helipilot_F"
```

## Jet Pilots
Units suited for flying that faction's fixed wing aircraft. One unit type is sufficient.
If the faction provides fighter jets, look for units with flight suits and oxygen masks.
If no one fits this category, helicopter pilots can be reused.

```sqf
"O_T_Pilot_F"
```
